Circadian Phase Relationship Between CRT and General Activity Rhythms in DD
To determine the circadian phase relationship between CRT and general activity rhythms in DD, an onset on the first day of the 10-day quantification interval in DD described previously was detected as a phase marker by the following method:
Firstly, a period during the 10-day interval was calculated by Chi-sq peridogram from 20-day data which include five days before and after the interval more to increase the accuracy of the period calculation. 20-day data were then split by the esitimated period, summed, and normalized to max and min values. The normalized data were summed cumulatively further and detrened. Local peaks and troughs of the detrended data were detected. Among many candidates of troughs as an onset, a trough of the closest peak-trough pairs whose mutual distance is largest was defind as the first onset of 20-day data. Finally, the first onset of 10-day data was calculated using the first onset and period of the 20-day data. The analysis was performed using custom MATLAB scripts available at: https://github.com/Takahashi-Lab-UTSW/Actogram-onset-detection.
